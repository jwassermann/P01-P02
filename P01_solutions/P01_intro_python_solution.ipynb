    "\"99 Bottles of Beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n",
    "Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task here is to write a Python program capable of generating all the verses of the song."

    "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT-13 (\"rotate by 13 places\") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented by means of the following dictionary:\n",
